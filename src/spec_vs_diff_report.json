  "summary": "The diff primarily adds a full new frontend app shell and multiple pages/components themed around an online casino reviews site branded as \"Yono Store\". Visible UI branding includes \"Yono Store\" in the home hero, header/footer logo alt text, and the admin sidebar. However, there is no clear evidence of updating the default HTML document metadata (e.g., <title>) to \"Yono Store\". The diff also introduces many unrequested new UI features/pages beyond simple rebranding.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Set default HTML document metadata to use \"Yono Store\" (at minimum: document title) so browser tabs and shared previews use the updated site name where applicable.",
